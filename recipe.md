# Delicious Chocolate Cake Recipe

## Ingredients:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 3/4 cups granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 cup chocolate chips
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- ...

## Instructions:
3. Stir in the baking powder, baking soda, and salt until evenly distributed.
4. In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs, then add the milk and vegetable oil. Stir to combine.
5. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry mixture and stir thoroughly until the batter is smooth.
6. Carefully add the boiling water and mix until fully incorporated. The batter will be thin—this is expected.
7. Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan lined with parchment paper (as Bob suggested).
8. Bake for 30–35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
9. Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

## Additional Directions by Bob:
4. Add a tablespoon of instant coffee to the dry ingredients for a hint of mocha flavour.
5. Mix in a handful of chocolate chunks for extra indulgence.
6. Line the bottom of the baking pan with parchment paper for easy cake removal.
